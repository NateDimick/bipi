# BiPi

BiPi is a Steam Big Picture config toggler. What does that mean? it means it's a simple UI that can run a series of cli commands at the flick of a switch.

Why? To make gaming on a TV that I have connected to my PC on a stupidly long HDMI cable easier. One click, everything toggles, one click and it's back.

## Steps to use

1. turn on tv and pc
2. launch Bipi app
3. toggle to big picture mode

## NB

This tool is highly tailored for my specific use case, and my machine with my configuration. It assumes everything from:

* audio sink ids
* display output names
* operating system and installed utilities
* the type of tv connected

If this looks like something you may also like, fork and build your own. This is not a solution for all, but it can be a template if anyone else has this pretty specific use case.

## Why not...?

Why not use Steam Link? Because the experience was not as latency-free as expected and required pairing a controller to the steam link

Why not use a dedicated pc for big picture like a htpc? I'm not made of money.
